- 👋 Hi, I’m Sundar.
- 👀 I’m interested in identifying requirements for Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Organization's data, building and deploying the frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate PyTorch. I completed the Udacity Deep learning course which gave me opportunity to build and deploy DL models using Pytorch. I am posting some of them here as I continue to learn more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with PyTorch developers on solving DL challenges.
